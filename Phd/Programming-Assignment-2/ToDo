- Build the Linear System Solver library
    - Adapt the codes from the LinearSystemSolver folder 
        - Jacobi
        - Gauss_Seidel
        - CG
        - BiCG
    - Scope of functions must be:
        double* METHOD_NAME (double *A, double *b)
            - Return the 'x' vector of the system
            - Matrix should be store contiguous in memory

- Build the Non-Linear System Solver library
    - Implement first the Newton method with Finite Differences (there are notes on the notebook)
    - Next implement the Jacobi and Gauss_Seidel iterations (they look simple ...)
    - The Newton method with Analitical Derivatives should introduce a new array on the problem_data
        - set_problem_fn **derivatives
