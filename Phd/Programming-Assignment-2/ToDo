- Build the Non-Linear System Solver library
    - Implement first the Newton method with Finite Differences (there are notes on the notebook)
    - Next implement the Jacobi and Gauss_Seidel iterations (they look simple ...)
    - The Newton method with Analitical Derivatives should introduce a new array on the problem_data
        - set_problem_fn **derivatives
